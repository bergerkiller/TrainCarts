This Minecraft Bukkit server plugin links carts together to form trains you can control!
Public transportation redefined. :)

This old repository hosts a much older version of TrainCarts, suitable for Minecraft/Forge 1.7.10.
TrainCarts uses [BKCommonLib](https://github.com/bergerkiller/BKCommonLib) for a lot of the required functionalities.
